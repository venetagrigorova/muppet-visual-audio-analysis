# Muppet Audio–Visual Analysis

This project does audio-visual frame classification using Fourier and spectral features, plus three or more advanced feature-engineering methods that don’t rely on deep learning. It also performs fusion across both audio and visual signals. The dataset consists of three Muppet Show episodes in AVI format and extended frame-level ground truth labels.
